1. I learned about high order functions like map(), filter() and reduce(), which can be really important in analyzing real workd data. Each of the high order functions served a good purpose, filter() filters specific items, map() transforms data, and reduce() sums up the values. Commenting on these function lines helped me find the logic behind the function and how the data flows.

2. I think the most confusing part of this task was the map() part and also the new set() function. In the beginning, I didn't really realize what the function does and how it created the array with ... and also how newset() removes the duplicated data. However, after breaking the code down and commenting on each line, I understood how it worked and that map() is only transofmring a small piece of data.
